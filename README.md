I am a PhD Candidate at the School of Government and Public Policy at UArizona. My research uses computational social science approaches and causal inference techniques to study corruption and violence in Latin America. In my dissertation I explore the institutional and political constraints of state audit agencies in Mexico. It evaluates which mayors are most likely to be sanctioned by state auditors based on political linkages. In my broader research agenda I use natural language processing and machine learning to extract information from Spanish language text.
