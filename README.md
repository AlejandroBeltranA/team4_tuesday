## Mario Mario 

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the School of Government and Public Policy at the University of Arizona. I am intereted on preventing addictions and violence in Mexico and Latin America. I have a background in anthropology and demography, so my research is characterized by a mixed-methods approach. I have worked in the public and private sectors on issues linked to Mexican security. I have also collaborated designing, implementing and evaluating a public health intervention in the Tijuana Police Department (i.e., SHIELD project).

I am a PhD Candidate at the School of Government and Public Policy at UArizona. My research uses computational social science approaches and causal inference techniques to study corruption and violence in Latin America. In my dissertation I explore the institutional and political constraints of state audit agencies in Mexico. It evaluates which mayors are most likely to be sanctioned by state auditors based on political linkages. In my broader research agenda I use natural language processing and machine learning to extract information from Spanish language text.
